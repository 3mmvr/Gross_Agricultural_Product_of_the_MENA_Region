## Analysis & Prediction of Gross Agricultural Product of the MENA Region

### Purpose:
This data science project aims to analyze and predict the Gross Agricultural Product (GAP) of countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The project involves exploring various agricultural data variables, identifying patterns, and building predictive models to understand the factors influencing agricultural production.

### Project Structure:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Importing necessary libraries and packages, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
   - Reading and loading datasets related to agricultural production, land data, and crop data.
   - Cleaning the data by removing unwanted columns and handling missing values.
   - Grouping and filtering MENA countries' data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzing the shape and structure of the dataset.
   - Identifying null values and performing data imputation.
   - Transforming data types for better analysis and visualization.
   - Grouping and categorizing data to focus on specific variables of interest.

3. **Visualization:**
   - Creating visualizations to better understand the data trends and relationships.
   - Visualizing gross agricultural production, arable land, harvested land, yield, and production quantity over time.
   - Utilizing area graphs and box plots to showcase top-performing countries in different aspects of agricultural production.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Computing correlation coefficients between different variables.
   - Visualizing correlations using a heatmap.
   - Examining the relationships between variables and the Gross Agricultural Product (GAP).

5. **Data Modeling:**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Applying machine learning techniques for prediction, including multivariate regression and decision tree regression.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like explained variance, mean squared error, and mean absolute error.

6. **Conclusion and Future Work:**
   - Summarizing the findings and insights from the data analysis and modeling.
   - Discussing the relationships between variables and their impact on agricultural production.
   - Suggesting potential areas for further research and improvements in the predictive models.
